Usually the installer/contractor would be able to certify or put some sort of written confirmation that the system is done to a certain standard and usually cipse is reverting, they can certainly follow other mainstream ventillation guidance or standards. He didn't specify which one. San mentioned DW172, but he doesn't have an idea on what that is but it seems that PWC would accept as long as the installer would give a written confirmation that the system being fitted is upto a certain recognisable standard.",

For example, if you have 3 tenants you will need\nfive copies of the form.\n• Attach all of the evidence listed on Page 20 to the back of each N5B form. This should be accompanied by supporting\nevidence such as explanatory notes if appropriate, and certificates of service (Form N215) confirming when and how the\nrelevant documents were served.\n• Send all copies of the document to the county court closest to the property that deals with housing matters\n• Attach a cheque for £355 payable to ‘HMCTS’\n\n\nOnce you have applied to court you should receive a notice of issue informing you that the tenant has 14 days to file a defence.\nFill out the section relating to you and return it to the court to confirm you still want a possession order.\n\nN119 should not be used with N5B as it is used for non-accelerated procedure (which is completely different from accelerated)",

The new ones are the plastics ones. \nyou need to make sure to connections to it . \n1) connections should not too high between the two pipes.  you would go for half of the invert of the subsequent hight  \n2) you tend to sweep around rather than going 90 degree on to the connection otherwise solid is gonna shoot over which will block up and create problems. example is 40-46 joyce street.\n\n4) - new drain pipes that go underground: should have the pea gravel all around. the drain pipe should be embedded in the Gravel so that leakages due to pipe breaking can be avoided.\n100mm pea bedding all around the pipe can save the breakage of pipe as result of any live load above e.g. the car weight etc.",

If not they need to contact united utilities and see if there's an external cause e.g water works etc.\n\nBefore contacting us there are a few checks you should do to figure out what’s causing the problem and who can help.\nThings to check if you have no water\nStep 1 – Try your cold kitchen tap\nIf water is coming out of this tap but nowhere else in your home, it’s very likely to be a problem with your internal plumbing. You need to contact an approved plumber or your landlord.\nStep 2 – Check for frozen pipes\nIn cold weather, you can usually spot a frozen pipe by the light coating of frost around it. If this happens, don't worry, read our help page for advice on what to do.\nStep 3 – Check your stop valves are open\nYour inside stop valve is usually placed under your kitchen sink. Check that it’s fully open by gently turning it anti-clockwise. You can use our guide to find out how to turn on your inside stop valve.\nStep 4 – Check with your neighbours\nThis can be a useful way to find out what the problem could be. For example, they may have been using the outside stop valve to do plumbing work without realising it affected your supply.\nIf there’s no issue with your neighbour’s water supply, the problem is likely to be with your plumbing. You should contact an approved plumber or your landlord.\nIf there’s also a problem with your neighbour’s water supply, it could be a problem with our network so check the next step to find out more.\nIf you live in a block of flats, check for known issues with your building maintenance contact, your local authority, or the managing agent of the building.\nStep 5 – Check for problems in your area\nYour supply might be affected by an issue we’re already working to fix. Search for your postcode on our map to see planned work taking place near you.\n\nCheck our network latest for more information and regular updates on problems in your area.",

  //       "BACKGROUND\n\nThe main purpose of a department is \n1. As a shell, to contain a set of recurring, task, problem,  solutions and goal, \n2. that is easily OVERSEEN by ONE user\n\nSub-departments can exist under a larger department, e.g. planning comes under Customer Works; VAT works under HMRC works. However, nested department is only useful when a user is overseeing sub-department, and even that you can express it differently (by using the priority number)\n\nChildren in Departments can cross over/overlap \ne.g. companies house works can be a department, which includes filing annual accounts, but the filing of letters is down to General Operations department, but both share some operations. \ne.g. a department can cross income and expenses (e.g. property repairs can be services 4, or expenses 7)\nOne shouldn’t worry too much about it, just put the children in one department or the other.\nServices that be offered out to others, should be treated as 4 instead of the others\nOne way to look at it, is that we are just a customer of the system, and that the system should churn up the same level of service to us and to the others\n\nThere are depts that are archaic \nBut they should still exist, just that there will be no recurring or tasks within it\n\n\nWhat is the problem of too many departments?\nAs long as they are indexed (using priority number), and without any overlaps, and are necessary, there shouldn’t be too many of them\n\nMultiple users maybe sharing the same department\nIs that the sign to split it further?\nAs long as the department can have ONE user being RESPONSIBLE, then it is allowed to have multiple users doing the tasks and recurring within it\n\nRESPONSIBLE means to \nUnderstand the problems, solutions and goals of the department\nKnow how to operate the tasks and recurring (even though the user may not be assigned on them)\nAble to create cnb to manage the works being done in the department by the others\n\n\nDepartments should avoid\n1. Having children department (sub department within a department), one should use the priority number to list them instead\n2. Being very broad. One should be broken down into very small sub-department, with minimum/no overlapping. As less overlap will mean clearer responsibility\n\n\n\nThe PRIORITY NUMBER system\n\n100\nAssets (Properties) related\n\n200\nFinance \n220\nGovernmental works \n230\nCustomer monies\n\n300\nPeople (HR)\n\n400\nCustomers/Services\n\n500\nTenants (which is a type of customer) but because it is too large it has its own numbers\n\n600\nSuppliers\n\n900\nGeneral/miscellaneous operations\n\nIt is acceptable, in the event of running out of numbers, to either\n1. Extend into the 1000, 1100\n2. In extreme circumstances, consider to add one more digit on all numbers (making 431 as 4310) to allow further segmentation\n\n\nNon-management departments should not have managers being the ASSIGNEE (CH, San and Mei)\nBecause managers need to be freed up to support and grow the users/their capability in the department\n\n\nIn Brains’ database\n- Department stays in the same table as wi/recur etc, \n    - Because in MS Access it will show as one treelike form\n\n\nAPPSHEET INTERFACE\n- Their own Department (Showing all children)\n- All departments (Showing all children)",

For example, Lets say the span was 1480. Using the table and sticking to 47 x and 400 you will scrolll down and find the number that is slightly above the span. E.g  47 x 125 and 400 = 1650. \n\nscreenshot on take photo of (in using ruler on drawings on paper/screen) showing the span, position of new purlins proposed, span direction\n\nscreenshot of the exact LINE from the TRADA span tables for each, including the headings showing the dead/imposed loads and spacings and timber strength (C16/C24)\n\nwrite out a sentence to confirm the sizing of the timbers\nalways use the exact wording on the trada span table, e.g. 47mm x 145mm, do not use nominal size (e.g. 50mmx150mm), do not use imperial (6x2), as you may create inaccuracies\n\ne.g. \nTimber calculations:\nUse C16 for all timbers, spacings every 400mm (c/c) \nFloor joist (span left to right)\n47mm x 145mm \nCeiling joist (span left to right)\n38mm x 145mm\nRafters \neither \n1. rafters only: 47mmx195mm\nor \n2. rafters and purlins\na. 47mm x 120mm rafters + 1x 72mmx245mm purlins in the middle span\nor \nb. 47mm x 120mm rafters + 1x 95mmx 220mm purlins in the middle span\n\n\n1. floor joist\nif you are building single storey extension on ground floor level, unless you are doing a suspended timber floor, you won't need it\nalways span the shortest distance\nspecify the span direction (left-right, front-back)\nget clear span\n? use middle table: More than 0.25 but not more than 0.5\n? when to use the others\n?always starts from 6x2 (47 × 145) upwards, because very likely builder needs to put sound insulation between floors\n\n2.

  //       "Template for Plastering, Skimming, Poly filling \n1. Gather everything you need\nSkimming is a time-sensitive task. Once you’re underway, you’ll need to work quickly to get the job done before things set. Here’s a list of all the equipment you’ll need to have handy:\n Plastic sheeting\n Hammer with nail pry tool\n Water-based primer\n Paint roller\n Ready-mix joint compound\n Quick-set joint compound (optional)\n Skimmer plate\n Large bucket\n Drill (if using quick-set)\n Mixing rod (if using quick-set)\n Trowel\n Taping knife\n Drywall knife (optional)\n Sandpaper\n Ladder (to reach high areas)\n Safety glasses\n2. Prepare the room\nFixing up your walls will get dusty. Save your floors and furniture from dirt and splatter by removing anything you can from the space and covering anything you can’t with plastic sheeting.\nCover the floor with protective sheeting and remove cover plates from your light switches and plug sockets to keep them free from splatters.\nIt’s also a good idea to cover doorways to save plaster dust from escaping into other rooms.\n3. Clean and prepare your walls\nBefore you start skimming, you’ll need to make sure your walls are clean from dust and that any cracks have been sealed. This will help you achieve a smooth finish with as few coats as possible.\nStart by scraping off any loose plaster, then fill the cracks using the pre-mix joint compound and either your taping knife or a smaller drywall knife. Pull any nails from the surface and fill in those holes in the same way.\nOnce your walls are repaired, you can dust and clean them down to remove any grime that might affect your plaster sticking.\nMake sure that all your walls are completely dry before moving onto the next step.\n4. Prime your surfaces\nUse a water-based primer to finish preparing your walls. With your roller, paint over every surface you are intending to plaster. The primer will help to seal any loose paper still on the walls and assist the adhesion of your joint compound.\nAgain, wait until your surfaces have dried before applying anything else to the walls.\n5. Mix your plaster\nIf you're using a quick-set joint compound you will need to mix it with water before use.\nMix your joint compound according to the instructions and remember to take note of the time limit printed on the packaging – this indicates how long you can use your mixed paste before it goes hard.\nMix the compound in your large bucket, using your drill with mixing attachment to make the process quicker (and easier on your arms).\nThe compound should form a mud-type consistency. Remember not to make too much compound at a time as the mixture won’t wet again once it has stiffened.\nIt can be useful at this point to pull in a helping hand, where available. While you set about plastering, your helper could start mixing your next batch of compound.\n6. Apply the first coat\n\n\nNow you’re ready to apply your first skim coat. Transfer your mixed compound to your skimmer plate – you want to be holding your skimmer plate in one hand and applying with the other.\nPile just a small amount of plaster onto your trowel, you can always add more later. Starting in one corner of the wall, drag your trowel vertically over the wall, applying a firm, even pressure.\nContinue to apply out from the first spot you have covered so that each new scoop slightly overlaps the last. This will help make sure you don’t leave gaps and create an even finish.\nLay the plaster as quickly as you can and try not to worry about leaving trowel marks – you can smooth these over on the second coat.\n\n\n7. Apply the finishing coats\nBe prepared to apply at least two coats for a smooth finish.\nYou don’t need to wait for the first coat to dry before applying the second. As soon as you’ve finished covering a wall, go back to the beginning for your next coat, dragging your trowel.\nThis is where you can focus on smoothing over trowel marks, making for a completely even surface.\nIf you can still see obvious grooves and indents after the second coat dries, trowel on a third coat and drag it vertically, so each layer is at a right angle to the one before.\nTry using a squeegee-like taping knife to taper the edges without leaving obvious trowel lines.\n8. Sand away imperfections\nWait until your walls are completely dry before picking up your sandpaper, this will probably take 24 hours.\nOnce the surfaces are completely stiff, smooth away any rough edges, bumps or grooves using fine-grit sandpaper (180-220 grit).\nIf you have some higher areas, you can sand these using slightly coarser paper (100-120 grit), blending them into the lower areas for a completely flat surface.\n9. Clean up\nOnce you're done, you’ll want to give the room a proper clean-up to remove any excess plaster dust.\nReach the hoover right up in the corners and along the walls themselves. Leaving excess dust will make the surface less adhesive to wallpaper paste or paint, so be sure not to miss any.\nAnd there you have it. Smooth and dust-free walls, ready to be decorated.\n\n\nTo Pollyfill a wall:\n1 Touch in nails and screw heads with oil based paint.\n2 Stir to a creamy consistency.\n3 Press into crack with a filling knife, smoothing off with a wet knife.\n4 For deeper repairs, above 10mm, build up in layers allowing to dry between applications.\n5 If necessary, sand down when fully dried.",

  //       "Things to think to ask about when hiring a roofer for a job\n1.  \tWhat are the pros & cons of different roofing solutions?\nFrom considering alternative materials for new fascias and soffits to roof repair solutions, a professional should let you know all the options available. Don’t just focus on cost. Ask your roofer to talk you through the pros and cons of each choice so that you can make an informed decision, considering both the short and long term condition of your roof.\n2.  \tWhat materials are best for the job?\nAsk your roofer about the various materials that can be used for projects such as installing a new roof. They shouldn’t just offer you one choice. For example, when it comes to flat roofs, you may like to discuss high performance felt or GRP fibreglass roofing.\n3.  \tWhat does the work involve?\nManage your expectations early by finding out what the work entails, how much disruption it will cause and expected timeframes for completion. This may reduce frustrations, and an expert roofer should keep you informed about progress along the way.\n4.  \tWhat could change the quote provided?\nMany companies offer a free quotation, but some do this before properly assessing your roof. Always check with your roofer whether the quotation will stay the same and reasons it could change. A professional should update you if the work is more extensive than originally thought.\n5.  \tCan you foresee any potential issues with the job?\nIf you think your roof needs a simple repair such as replacing a few loose tiles, it can be a shock if you discover the job is more complex. Ask your roofer if they have any concerns about the work and what needs to happen before finalising details.\n6.  \tAre you an in-house team?\nMake sure that you’re dealing with a team from one company, i.e. those who assess your roof are part of the same team who will be completing the work. Never accept the job being subcontracted out unless they’re a legitimate company you’re willing to work with.\n7.  \tDo you offer competitive pricing?\nWhile pricing should be transparent, if you’re getting several quotations for the same job, don’t feel afraid to ask your roofer if they offer competitive pricing.\n8.  \tDo you require a deposit?\nAlways check a roofer’s quote and you can even ask to see a breakdown of the costs involved, finding a company who don’t expect an upfront deposit. This ensures you only pay for work which has been completed to satisfaction.\n9.  \tDo you offer a guarantee on work completed?\nAny materials a roofer uses should have a warranty, but a reputable company will also provide a guarantee on the roofing services they provide. Here at Collier Roofing, we offer a personal 10 year written guarantee on our services, as well as a 20 year warranty on selected materials.\n10. Can I see your accreditations?\nA reputable trader will be a member of officially recognised bodies, and for roofers, this includes UK Trading Standards and Icopal. You can also use Checkatrade to find out how they’ve been rated by previous customers.\nTimeline for Roof Replacement or Roof Repair\nAsk your roofing company about how long it will take them to complete the roof replacement or roof repair. Repairing it will take considerably less time than replacing the whole roof. However, once the roofing contractors have inspected your roof, they will be able to tell you how long it will take to complete the work. \nThis is especially important if you’re getting a roof replacement and choosing to stay elsewhere until it’s finished. Whether you’re staying with family and friends or staying at a hotel, you’ll want to know how long you should be prepared to be away from home. Alternatively, if you decide to stay home during the roof replacement, it can be a major disruption to your daily life. Knowing how long it will take to complete can be helpful in planning and preparing. \n\n\nCost of a New Roof or Roof Repair\nOf course you’ll want to ask about the cost. In general, there are a few factors that will always affect the cost of repairing or replacing your roof. These factors include size of the roof and slope of the roof. These factors tell your roofing contractor how much labor they’ll be required to do, and therefore how much it will cost you.\nAdditionally, depending on your location, how difficult it is to get to your home, or other factors, there may be additional things that contribute to the cost of your roof repair or replacement. \nThe type of roofing material you are getting can contribute to the cost significantly. Shingle roofing is considerably less expensive than metal roofing and tile roofing. Your roofing company can give you an exact quote based on the material you have on your roof. \nThe most important thing to ask your roofer about is whether the cost on the quote could change at any point. A reliable roofing company is upfront in the beginning about the cost and any potential factors that could change the amount you are given. You shouldn’t be hit with any surprise fees or additional costs. Ask them ahead of time if there are any factors that could change the initial quote in any way. Things that could affect the cost are: underlying roof damage, additional needed repairs, or other unforeseen circumstances. If your roofing contractor thinks one of these is a possibility, it’s important that they tell you upfront. \n \nIt is important to get more than one quotation per job and compare what works are included in each quote. They  also need to diagnose any problems they can see/notice once they are on the roof itself inside and out that may lead to any other issues later down the line.\n\nwe should always send them the effect of the problem so the internal photos  we should try to let them know about the area it is leaking from \nany photos and videos we have of the outside clearly showing theres a problem we should send to them.\nTo diagnose what the problem is",

Checklist\n\nCheck Site Plan by comparing to digimap\nGuidelines for James about Site Plan (based on project: 348 Manchester)\nResolution must be set up to 600 when import digimap pdf.\nThe site plan usually needs to be on scale of 1:200 or 1: 500\nCrop the viewport accordingly.\nDo not forget to put your name in the sheets whenever you make amendments in the project. \nAnnotate the road and adjacent buildings\nPut north and scale bar\n\nCheck the Drawings (by making comparison)\nBefore starting to check the drawings….Always Open \nSurvey documentation, \nOpen google map \nand google earth as well. \nAnd Start Matching everything. (Priority of accuracy should be considered in that order 1. Digimap, then 2. Survey measurements, then 3. survey photos, and then the 4. google maps/earth)\n\nCheck the Roof\ntop view from google and see if the pitch (slop, lines and point) seems similar in the drawings. \nUse Digimap to see the size and shape of the whole building (perimeter).\nSee top view on google map to see the lines and points of pitch roofs. \nSee the photos or google earth to figure out roof angle / slope / height etc. \nWe can observe the angle by comparing 90 degree/ 45 degree. Or we can see how many times the roof ridge seems high as compared to the total height of the building. E.g. Sometimes each floor of a 2 storey building has a height of 2400 mm and the ridge seems to have the same height as one storey/floor. So in this case if the house is small the pitch angle must be 35 to 30 degrees. It's all about keen observation with your eyes. \n\nCheck the Heights\nCheck the heights (use existing check elevations drawings): is it matching with survey and seems similar with google as well.  If it does;not seem accurate, check it in detail. \nA quick check can be done by observing the shape of each side of elevations. E.g the front elevation seems exact square to my eye (from survey photos and google map) So, it must be the exact square shaped front elevation in the drawings. It tells the accuracy of heights. \n\nCheck the Elements\nCheck the elements (in the elevation/3D-view drawings), as their position and size seems similar to the survey photos.\nWindows/Doors design and position. Use photos to make comparisons E.g. if the size, shape or position of windows seems different . then go and check the survey elevations, sketch or count the bricks. \nOther Decorative elements \nEave extensions (How much ?small large etc)\nHave the draughtsman put drainage pipes as per existing documentation?\n\nCheck the Plans\nCheck the Plans (use existing check plans)\nUse the survey measurements to make comparisons. \nSee the total width and depth of building first, \nThen the measurements along the whole perimeter of the building.\nThen total length and width of each space/room.\nCheck if all rooms are accessible/ or have doors. If not, check the survey if the doors are missed on the survey then try to figure out.",

  //       "Step 1\n\nMake two parallel lines. Start by using a chalk reel to snap two parallel lines down the center of the soffit. Space the lines 2 in. apart, allowing the vent to overlap the cutout by ½ in. on each edge.\n\nStep 2\n\nNext, bore a 3⁄4- or 1-in.-dia. hole through the soffit right between the lines and measure the thickness of the soffit panel (probably 1⁄4 or 3⁄8 in.). Then set your circular saw to that depth and cut along the chalk lines.\nCut the two parallel lines with a portable circular saw. Set the blade depth to cut through the thin soffit material barely.\n\nStep 3 connect the two cuts.\n\nWhen you near the end of the soffit, stop short and connect the two cuts with a sharp chisel or sabre saw. Once all cuts are made, use a thin pry bar to remove the 2-in. plywood strip. Pull any nails that remain in the soffit framing with a cat’s paw.\nThen inspect the length of the vent cutout. If there’s any insulation clogging the slot, pull it out or shove it back up.\n\nStep 5: Attach vent to soffit\n\nUse a cordless drill/driver to secure the vent to the soffit with ½-in.-long No. 4 sheet-metal screws. Continue installing additional strip vents until you reach the far end. Trim the last vent to length using aviation snips.\n\nStep 6: Remove any insulation from the new vent.\n\nThe soffit vents are now installed, but you still need to make sure there’s no insulation blocking the new vents. If the attic is insulated with fiberglass batts, just pull back any that are blocking the flow of air. If there’s blown-in insulation, like ours, rake back the fluffy stuff with a 3- or 4-ft.-long 1 x 6, or use a garden rake or hoe.\n\nStep 7:Install the ventilation baffle.\n\nFinally, to ensure that the airway to the vent remains open, staple a ventilation baffle to the plywood sheathing in each rafter bay. The molded polystyrene baffles, available at home centers and lumberyards for about $1 each, form channels that hold insulation at bay and direct incoming air upward.",
